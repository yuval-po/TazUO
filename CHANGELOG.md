# Changelog
All notable changes to TazUO will be recorded here.

---

## 9/10/26
* ***Feature:*** Added `ForceDriver = 4` to force DirectX 11. Set it in the profile's `settings.json`. This can significantly improve performance on some Windows machines where OpenGL performs poorly. **If you experience low FPS or unusually poor performance, try setting `ForceDriver` to `4`** - [P.R 1067](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/1067) ([LasherasGH](https://github.com/LasherasGH))
* ***Legion:*** Added `API.TargetRel()` to target the topmost visible object (entity, static/multi, or land) at a tile offset from the player, and added `Target()`/`TargetRel()` to entity objects to target the entity itself or a tile relative to its position
* ***Legion:*** Fixed `API.TargetTileRel()` to target the highest non-land tile at the location instead of the base land tile. `API.TargetRel()`, `API.TargetTileRel()`, and entity `TargetRel()` accept a new `tilesOnly` argument (default `True`) to ignore entities
* ***Fix:*** Fixed `PlayerMobile.IsCasting` not being cleared when a spell finished casting successfully, which could leave the self-heal hotkey and scripts waiting on a cast that had already ended. The casting freeze now only releases the freeze the client applied, so it no longer clears server-side paralysis on an HP change

## 9/8/26
* ***Feature:*** Added a "Multi Move" sub-menu to the grid container context menu for selecting items into the multi-move system - "Select all", "Select by layer" (populated only with layers present in the container), "Select by graphic" (each entry shows the item's art next to its graphic id), and "Select by name" (distinct item names, no duplicates)
* ***Fix:*** Fixed a NullReferenceException when opening a grid container caused by the new "Multi Move" context menu being built before the container's slot manager existed

## 9/7/26
* ***Legion:*** Added optional filters to `API.GetAllMobiles()` - `name` (case-insensitive partial match), `graphics`, `hues`, `minDistance`, `isHuman`, `isFemale`, `isGhost` (dead mobiles), `isFriend` (friends list), `poisoned`, `paralyzed`, and `hasLineOfSight`; each is ignored unless supplied, and `True`/`False` toggles include or exclude
* ***Fix:*** Added a crash fix suggestion for when SDL cannot start the video system because the OS offers no display to the process (game launched outside a graphical desktop session, e.g. over SSH or on a headless machine) - crash logs now explain the cause and how to launch the game with a desktop display
* ***Fix:*** Fixed a `ThreadInterruptedException` client crash when stopping a Legion script at the exact moment it was finishing on its own - the stop's pending thread interrupt now surfaces safely at the script's final cleanup instead of killing the script thread as an unhandled exception

## 9/6/26
* ***Misc:*** Changed city selection gump to use clilocs for facet location instead of hard coded
* ***Feature:*** Added ObjectUsed API event, support for multi-sound/serial overlay triggers and a new ObjectUsed overlay trigger - [P.R 1051](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/1051) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))

## 9/5/26
* ***Fix:*** Fixed nameplate profiles not working with modifier only hotkeys
* ***Fix:*** Fixed the world map "always show markers at any zoom" option not showing marker name labels when zoomed out - labels now respect the always-show override instead of being hidden below zoom level 6
* ***Fix:*** Fixed a NullReferenceException in world map pathfinding when the player left the world or closed the map gump while a path search was still running on its background thread - the completion and step-failed callbacks now check whether the world/player is still present and abandon cleanly instead of crashing
* ***Legion:*** Hardened the Legion scripting API against the world, player, or map going null while a script is running (e.g. during world teardown) - calls like `API.Pathfind`, `API.PathfindEntity`, `API.GetPath`, movement, targeting, and item handling now safely return false/null instead of throwing a NullReferenceException
* ***Fix:*** Fixed version number in PR builds
* ***Legion:*** Fixed a Legion script being wrongly reported as "did not stop and keeps running in the background" (and then locked out of restarting) when it was stopped and started again within the 2 second stop grace period - the stop check now only acts on the exact thread it was issued for, so a stale check can't mistake a new run for an unstopped one
* ***Legion:*** Fixed a legion script crash when player was null checking for skills

## 9/4/26
* ***Feature:*** Custom cooldown bars now continue checking later rules when a sender filter does not match and no longer treat messages without a source as Self or Other

### Features

* Added a new modern horizontal status bar option
* Added a new modern horizontal compact status bar option
* Added a new modern compact status bar option

* Separated Scavenger agent from Autoloot, they now each have their own loot lists and enabled/disabled toggles
* Added a per-container option to disable grid highlighting without affecting other containers - [P.R 1032](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/1032) ([Aryx75](https://github.com/Aryx75))
* Added a world map context menu option to always show map markers regardless of zoom level

* Added a warning when running a script with unbounded while loops
* Added `API.IsKeyPressed("CTRL+SHIFT+F1")` method to see if a key(s) is currently held down

* Removed hard 30 second limit on `API.Pause()`
* Added `GetSpellsInSpellbook(uint serial)`, listing all spell names in that spellbook

### Misc
* Mouse handling performance improvements
* Added auto pruning to Item Database to prevent unbounded database growth ( 120 days since item last seen, it's deleted )
* Increase max global scale to 300% up from 175%
* Migrated more settings to global scoped json settings

### Fixes
* Fixed the health bar indicator threshold so its percentage setting is applied correctly - [P.R 1052](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/1052) ([Aryx75](https://github.com/Aryx75))
* Fixed a NullReferenceException in `API.UseSkill()` when the player was null (world tearing down) or the skill list was not yet loaded - the call now safely returns without using the skill
* Fixed missing key codes in plugin keyup processing
* Fixed timestamped Global Chat messages sent by the local player not appearing in Global Chat journal tabs - [P.R 1035](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/1035) ([Aryx75](https://github.com/Aryx75))
* Fixed a crash (`IndexOutOfRangeException` in `Mobile.Draw`) that could occur when rendering a mobile whose queued walk step carried an unmasked direction byte (e.g. the running flag) - the direction is now always normalized to 0-7 before use
* Fixed a client crash at startup when the generated `Data/Client` files (`chair.txt`, `lights.txt`, `lightshaders.txt`) could not be written or read because another process (antivirus, OneDrive, a second instance, or an editor) held a lock on them - the client now logs a clear error and continues with the built-in defaults instead of crashing
* Fixed locked grid container items no longer reclaiming their locked cell (and appearing unlocked) after being moved out of the container and back
* Addressed a cross-thread issue and hardened controls a bit against future cross threading
* Added a crash fix suggestion for when Windows blocks one of TazUO's files with an application control policy, whether a managed assembly loaded at runtime (for example MP3Sharp.dll) or a native library (for example FNA3D.dll) failing during startup
* Fixed a client crash at login when the persistent-vars database could not be created or opened (e.g. the game's Data directory is not writable) - the client now logs a clear error and keeps running, with script variables simply not persisted until the directory is writable again
* Hardened the SQLite layer to also quarantine and rebuild database files that cannot be opened (SQLite "unable to open database file"), not just files detected as corrupt
* Fixed a client crash when using `API.Gumps.CreateGumpRenderedMapArea` (map offsets were being dereferenced as pointers), and made it render only the requested region with proper cleanup on close
* Fixed a crash fix for a race condition while opening a container during shutdown
* Fixed a NullReferenceException when opening a grid container while the world was tearing down (player could be nulled mid-construction)
* Myra sliders and checkboxes no longer listen to right clicks (Causing accidental changed when closing via right click over a checkbox/slider)
* Improved treasure map location calculations - [P.R 1012](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/1012) [Erumite](https://github.com/Erumite)
* Door movement blocking no longer stops you from walking into closed doors when the "Open doors while pathfinding" (smooth doors) setting is enabled, and the option label is now "Block walking into doors"
* Fixed a client crash at startup when `settings.json` is missing or corrupt - command-line arguments are now applied after the fallback settings are restored
* Fixed a NullReferenceException when an extended stats packet (0x19) arrived while the world was tearing down (player could be nulled mid-construction)
* Fixed a NullReferenceException in the journal when a journal entry could not be recycled from the journal history (a torn read of the non-thread-safe journal deque) - the client now falls back to a fresh entry, skips null/whitespace message text, and `API.HeadMsg` ignores empty messages
* Added a crash fix suggestion when a crash happens on a background thread spawned by a third-party plugin/assistant (for example a UO copilot running its own UI) - the crash log now points to the plugin as the likely cause instead of TazUO

## 5.31.2

### Legion
* Added a `sortby` parameter to `API.GetAllMobiles()`, supporting `Distance`, `Hits`, and `MaxHits` (case insensitive, defaults to `Distance`)

### Features
* Tooltip overrides now support global, account, server, and char specific entries
* Added max option to autoloot (autoloot up to x amt in your destination bag)
* Added a new overlay system event trigger - Buff/Debuff - [P.R 974](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/974) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Added search functionality to the Tinkerer's Art Browser - [P.R 974](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/974) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Added a translucent ground preview of the item being dragged, shown on the tile it would land on when dropped on the ground (drag distance and Z-banded), toggleable under Gameplay -> Misc, enabled by default ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added an option to classify timestamped system messages as Global Chat using configurable regular expressions - [P.R 1014](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/1014) ([Aryx75](https://github.com/Aryx75))

### Misc

* Added 2 new crash fix suggestions for Windows based systems - [P.R 994](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/994) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Added spacing before capitals on equipement layer tooltips in paperdolls
* Changed Dress and Organizer agent tabs to have a more compact list instead of awkward buttons for configs
* The classic journal gump (JournalGump) now respects the "Hide journal timestamps" setting, which was moved from per-profile to machine-wide (global) settings

### Fixes
* The right/bottom dead space that appeared when using a global scale below 100% is now usable: gumps, windows, containers, and the world viewport can be dragged into and interacted with there, and gumps/dropdowns/tooltips now center and clamp against the full visible window instead of the shrunken world view
* Properly restore corpse container position after new game session
* Attempt to catch plugin crashes before the kill the client
* Fix a rare crash fix on periphial input before profiles have been loaded

* Tooltip overrides should no long show a long number like -1.797673xxxxxxxxxxxx randomly
* Fixed login music being silenced when the regular music toggle was off: login music now uses its own enable/volume settings independently of the main music setting
* Fixed an issue where corrupt Info-Bars could prevent client from loading - [P.R 980](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/980) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Fixed a double max height in persistent vars window

## 5.28.1

### Legion

* Added `.IsParalyzed` to mobile objects

### Features
* Added a visual effects composition and management system to allow for custom UI effects such as fog and blur. - [P.R 958](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/958) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Added a right-click option to the Journal tab on the top menu bar that opens a context menu with an "Open original journal" option, opening the classic `JournalGump` instead of the resizable journal
* Added a setting to show heal/cure buttons on pet health bars, separate from the existing all-health-bar and friends-list toggles ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added current global action queue and main thread queue counts to the Profiler window, along with a button to clear the action queue, all refreshed at 250ms
* Added an option to block walking into closed doors, preventing walk requests that the server rejects and the client bounces back from ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Redesign bandage agent tab UI, and add option to use a server command for self heal ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added a configurable bandage distance to the Bandage Agent (1-15 tiles, default 3) that controls how far friends and allies must be to be bandaged, replacing the previously hardcoded 3-tile range ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added a configurable auto-target type option to the Bandage Agent (Neutral/Harmful/Beneficial), replacing the previously hardcoded beneficial target type ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* When a pin is placed on a server-sent map gump, the client now prints a message with the deciphered coordinates ("I can't be certain but I believe this is somewhere near {x} and {y}.")
* Corpse grid containers now remember their own position (separate from regular containers), saving and restoring it per profile ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

### Misc
* Replace tooltip override window with a new, easier to view and understand window
* Right click to close should be more accurate now
* Drawing one more tile outside the viewport for smooth static loading
* Clicking login music toggle on login screen should stop music now
* Improved client performance when entering heavily populated areas: network packets are now processed under a per-frame time budget instead of a fixed message cap, unchanged item/mobile updates are skipped, and world object lookups/insertions use single-hash dictionary operations
* Moved the corpse opening settings (auto open corpses, corpse open distance, corpse open options) from the Misc options tab into a "Corpse Opening" container under Gameplay -> Mobiles -> Misc ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Made looting take higher priority over opening corpses *except your own corpse and manually opened corpses*
* Migrated WASD Movement and Single click to cast spell settings to Global settings, migrated turn delay to server settings ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Add some missing weapon abilities

### Fixes
* Fixed a `NoAudioHardwareException` crash on machines without an audio device: the audio availability probe no longer creates a `DynamicSoundEffectInstance` (which left a partially-built object for the GC finalizer to crash on) and instead reads `SoundEffect.MasterVolume` ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Remove presets for auto skinnig knife id's to prevent trying to use the incorrect item on servers ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed a rare crash that could occur when a grid container is moved - [P.R 958](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/958) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Fixed the candle flicker effect speeding up while moving: the flicker phase is now seeded from each light's world position instead of its screen position, so it oscillates at a constant speed
* Fixed a NullReferenceException in the counter bar when an item or spell graphic could not be loaded; the icon is now skipped instead of crashing the client ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed stuttering on UltimaLive servers: `GetBlockCrc` now reads the map/statics block with bulk reads instead of one locked seek+read syscall per byte, terrain updates no longer re-read the same map blocks from disk dozens of times per chunk (cached on stream-based files), chunk reloads triggered by streamed terrain/statics updates are now coalesced and time-throttled (rebuilt at most once per frame, spread across frames instead of all at once), and packet file writes are no longer flushed synchronously on the render thread (flushing moved to a background thread) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` on UltimaLive servers when the client connected: all reads on UltimaLive's dynamically-growing map/statics files are now serialized under a single lock (previously some read paths bypassed it and could race with the background flush thread) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed a 1-2 second freeze when taking a screenshot: PNG encoding and file writing now run on a background thread so the frame is no longer stalled

## 5.24.5

* Auto skinning was not firing for old grid loot style ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Query for criminal action should not continue reopening for the same serial ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed a crash (`NoAudioHardwareException`) when the audio device becomes unavailable while sounds are still held by the client; sound instances are now disposed deterministically instead of being left to the garbage collector, so the audio finalizer can no longer crash the client - [P.R 916](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/916) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed the Alt/Shift/Ctrl modifier state getting stuck after Alt+Tab, since the key-up event is never delivered when the window loses focus; modifiers are now cleared on focus loss/gain ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added a suggested crash fix for plugins crashing TazUO while injecting a network packet into the client (e.g. an assistant's `SendToClient` passing a packet that does not fit its buffer), pointing the user at the plugin rather than TazUO ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed target aura not in the correct spot when game scaled - [P.R 911](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/911) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed a NullReferenceException when scrolling with the opacity hotkey after the current profile is unloaded - [P.R 910](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/910) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

### Misc
* When built in Debug there is now an asset load time on the login scene ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Moved Cliloc load to load async, improving load times when starting the client - [P.R 899](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/899) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Migrated circle of transparency and sound/music settings (master sound/music volume, footsteps, rain, combat music, background audio) from per-character profiles to global settings ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

## 5.22.15

### Legion
* Added `Highlight(hue)` to game objects, setting the hue and remembering the original so it can be restored with `Highlight(None)`; on mobiles it also recolors all equipped items - [P.R 881](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/881) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added `API.UpdateCooldown(name, maxValue, currentValue)`, `API.RestartCooldown(name)`, `API.DeleteCooldown(name)` and `API.CooldownExists(name)` to manage cooldown bars created with `API.CreateCooldownBar` ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

### Features
* Added Friend option to Select Nearest macro - ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added tooltips to empty slots on paperdoll for what layer they are ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

* Added a Randomize button to the character creation screen that picks random hair/facial hair styles and random colors (skin, shirt, pants, hair, beard) while keeping the selected race and gender ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Spell names, reagent names, and magic circle names now use server cliloc strings when available, falling back to the built-in English strings otherwise - [P.R 885](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/885) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

### Fixes
* Fixed an `IO_SharingViolation_File` crash when running multiple TazUO clients against a shared `Data/language.*.ini`; language files are now opened with shared read/write access and rewritten atomically via a temp file so concurrent clients can read and merge them without collisions ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed a NullReferenceException when toggling "Stay active" in the nameplate manager gump on shards whose gumpart is missing the radio button art; failed button construction is now handled gracefully instead of leaving a broken control behind ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed empty chat input entries being saved to the message history - [P.R 900](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/900) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed a rare "The deque is empty" crash when processing mobile movement steps, caused by the steps deque being cleared concurrently while the main thread removed a step ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Minor UI bug fixes in modern paperdoll and myra windows ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* MacroManager select next/previous/nearest with the Hostile scan type now skips anyone on the friends list - [P.R 880](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/880) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Auto skinning now responds to any target cursor type instead of only neutral, so it works on servers that send a different target type for the skinning knife - [P.R 879](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/879) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed in-game screenshots showing the world viewport as partially transparent by forcing the saved image to be fully opaque - [P.R 870](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/870) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fix journal partially scrolled sometimes still scrolling up - [P.R 858](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/858) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

### Misc
* Updated to latest FNA release ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Converted previous ResGumps language system into TazLang language.ini system ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Converted ResGeneral and ResErrorMessages into TazLang language.ini system ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

## 5.20.26

### Legion
* Added `API.ActiveSpells()`, `API.ActiveSpellNames()` and `API.IsSpellActive(spell)` so scripts can see which toggle spells/moves are currently active (the same ones the spell bar highlights) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

### Features
* Option window font selectors are now searchable - [P.R 847](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/847) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Counter bar slots can now trigger Dress or Undress for any dress-agent configuration belonging to the current character - [P.R 844](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/844) ([Nesci28](https://github.com/Nesci28))
* The Legion Script Manager window now remembers its size and position and restores them when reopened - [P.R 828](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/828) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added an optional candle flicker effect that makes lights gently ebb and flow (enabled by default, toggle under Video > Lighting) - [P.R 824](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/824) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added optional FSR shader to post processing effects - [P.R 821](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/821) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Assistant Macros tab action selector is now searchable (Searchable Combobox support) - [P.R 823](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/823) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Counter bar cells can now hold any spell bar action (spell, macro, weapon ability, script, or skill) in addition to item counters, with per-cell hotkeys (via the shared hotkey window), optional keybind labels, active-ability highlighting, and a hotkey-press flash - [P.R 812](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/812) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

### Fixes
* Guard GameActions.Print against null world(Causing a rare crash when trying to send a message before game world is initialized) - [P.R 852](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/852) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Address a concurrency issue causing a rare crash - [P.R 851](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/851) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Fixed ScriptManagerWindow not restoring to the correct size - [P.R 847](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/847) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))
* Fixed the bandage agent monopolizing the shared action queue: heals still run through the queue, but the queued heal is now re-validated when it runs and only resets the global action cooldown on rounds where a bandage is actually applied - so no-op heal rounds (mobile recovered, still on the bandage timer, no bandage, etc.) no longer stall the player's own queued loot/move/equip actions - [P.R 846](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/846) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed text draw position bouncing with always show names enabled - [P.R 840](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/840) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

* Fixed mobile names not being drawn at the edge of the screen for off-screen mobiles - [P.R 838](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/838) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Added a suggested crash fix for "Bad uop file" errors, explaining that a `.uop` data file is corrupt, truncated, or mid-patch and how to resolve it - [P.R 841](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/841) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Guarded the remaining LegionAPI/ApiUiGump methods that touched the game world, UI manager, or gump controls off the main thread, fixing a double-free malloc crash caused by Legion scripts racing with the main thread - [P.R 836](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/836) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

* Added an optional toggle (enabled by default) to ignore tooltip overrides for mobiles, so their raw tooltip text is shown instead of override-formatted text - [P.R 784](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/784) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* The grid container top/label section now accepts target cursors to select the container (bag) itself, matching how clicking an empty grid slot behaves - [P.R 781](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/781) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

* Fixed an IndexOutOfRangeException crash in FontStashSharp caused by Legion script error handlers printing messages and building error windows on the script's background thread; those UI calls now run on the main thread so the shared, non-thread-safe font caches aren't corrupted - [P.R 770](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/770) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed missing mouse binding support for Assistant -> Macro hotkeys - [P.R 764](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/764) ([yuval-po](https://github.com/yuval-po))

* Fixed tooltip overrides no longer applying to items shown in server-sent gumps (which aren't real world items, like vendor search results); the override now falls back to the item's OPL text instead of showing the raw tooltip - [P.R 767](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/767) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed a FormatException crash when loading a world map marker file that contained a malformed line; malformed lines are now logged and skipped instead of crashing the client, and a warning is shown in-game noting how many lines were skipped - [P.R 763](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/763) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed an IndexOutOfRangeException crash when the server sent a map change (ExtendedCommand 0x08) with an out-of-range map index while no map was loaded; the index is now clamped before the map is constructed - [P.R 762](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/762) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

* Fixed an IndexOutOfRangeException crash in FontStashSharp caused by CustomToolTip building and measuring tooltip text on a background thread; the retry now runs on the main thread so the shared, non-thread-safe font caches aren't corrupted - [P.R 753](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/753) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
* Fixed an ArgumentNullException crash in TrueTypeLoader.GetFont when called with a null or empty font name; it now falls back to the default embedded font - [P.R 750](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/750) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

* World map mobile dots are now colored by notoriety (matching the radar/minimap) instead of always being red - [P.R 684](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/684) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))

* Added an optional `API.OnStop(callback)` hook — when set, stopping a script is delayed until the callback is processed via `API.ProcessCallbacks` or a maximum of 5 seconds has elapsed - [P.R 652](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO/pull/652) ([bittiez](https://github.com/bittiez))
